Hi,

Welcome to another impossible project i am probably not smart enough for :)

Anywayyyy

Time to make a rpg webbrouwser game

Tools: React, Sass (later: php sql);

First: map and movement

other ideas:
- Xp to level
- turnbased fights
- inventory
- items weapons armor potions/food
- story with choice options to make the briefings and deliveries less boring
- hidden quest based on story choice
- quests based on story choices
- main quest (big fights)
- side quests (kill beast, talk to someone, deliveries)
- chests 
- set class with skill tree/progression (like wow)

later ideas:
- crafting
- game saving
-
